What is an Array?

An array is collection of items that could be either integers, strings, anything.
The items are stored in contiguous memory locations,(checking is straightforward).
The two most primitive operations:
- Writing Elements
- Reading Elements


Array Capacity & Length of an Array
Capacity : The total it can hold
Length : Currently holding

We need to declare about the length of Array prior.

When an Array is given as perimenter, we can say that `length == perimeter`
