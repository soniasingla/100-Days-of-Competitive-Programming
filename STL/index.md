**Templates in C++**

Pass data type as a parameter so we don't need to write the same code for different data-types. Rather than writing and maintaining the big code, we can have one function and pass the data-type as perimeter.

**Keywords used :**
1. `template`
2. `typename` or `class`

**How they work?**

Templates expand at compiler time and the complier checks before it's expansion.

**Arguments to templates**

As in normal parameters, we can pass more than one data-type as arguments to templates.

**Default value for template arguments**

As in normal parameters, we can specify the default arguments.

**Function Overloading v/s Templates**

Function Overloading : multiple functions do similar operations
Templates : multiple functions do identical operations

**STL ??**
set of C++ templates to provide common programming data structures and functions.

**Components**
1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators
